Bus route optimization using different search algorithms - paper 3

algorithms such as breadth, depth, A* and D* for the inclusion of a cost variable which could be distance or time.
compare how the algorithms work and which one is more suited for the problem at hand.
mabye show where each algorithm is best suited challenge wise and say why it is not get used to its full potential.
Uniform cost search Rather than just searching one path for the goal state it checks all other possible paths in case their is a cheaper route to go down.

different to dijikstras as it doesnt use a prioritu queue, instead it only uses one source (the start goal) and moves on to a different state but keeping other optional paths open by allowing us to plan the route then go along optimal path.
